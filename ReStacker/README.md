ReStacker
=========
This is a very simple script which periodically runs through all items with inventories, and
if it finds multiple stacks of the same item, it combines them into a single item.

Note any block with [LOCKED] in the name is ignored.

Instructions
------------
1. Add programmable block, add script, click recompile/run - No config required
