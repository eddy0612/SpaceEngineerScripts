### JSharedUtils

This is a shared utility class and on its own serves no purpose

Embedded classes:
- JCTRL for interacting with helms or cockpits and treating them as a controller
- JLCD for writing to LCDs, dynamically working out font sizes, colors, setting rotation etc
- JINV for storing some common data around inventories and blueprints etc
- JDBG as a set of classes I use when debugging

I dont plan on giving any instructions on using these classes but if you have any questions feel free to ask in the discussions area
